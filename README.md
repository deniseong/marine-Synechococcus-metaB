# marine-Synechococcus-metaB

Directories

- sample list? does this include extensive metadata (eg. temp, salinity)

In geneious:
- fasta of the database reformatted for use with DADA2
- phylogenetic tree of petB with the length of sequence processed with Mazard_2012 and Ong_2022
- alignment of whole petB gene loci with petB-F, petB-F50, petB-R and petB-634R
- amino acid alignment of each subclade with Mazard_2012 and Ong_2022

For R:
- script for DADA2 to process raw Illumina sequences?
- raw sequences? or is this directly deposited in NCBI

- Mazard_2012 ASV table
- Phyloseq used to make figures

Ong_2022: Filtered seawater amplified with Ong_2022
- fasta file with all Ong_2022 ASV sequences
- Ong_2022 ASV table
- Phyloseq used to make figures

sorted_syn: Sorted Synechococcus cells amplified with Ong_2022
- fasta file with all sorted_syn ASV sequences
- sorted_syn ASV table
